# Learning Roadmap for R Shiny Web Application Development

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to learning R and Shiny Web Application development with a project-based approach for programmers familiar with coding and R. There would be a brief reminder on the basic concepts. Still, you can always dig deeper into topics.

## Learning Plan

### Weeks 1-2: Basics of R

1. **R Syntax and Basic Operations**
   - Variables, assignment, and data types.
   - Arithmetic and logical operations.

2. **Data Structures in R**
   - Vectors, matrices, lists, data frames.

3. **Control Flow in R**
   - Conditions (`if-else`), loops (`for`, `while`).

4. **Basic R Functions**
   - Built-in functions like `sort()`, `mean()`, `sum()`, etc.
   - Writing custom functions.

5. **Data Manipulation with R**
   - Getting started with `dplyr`, `tidyr` packages.

6. **Basic Data Visualization with R**
   - Start with basic plotting functions in R.

### Weeks 3-4: Introduction to R Shiny

1. **Introduction to Shiny and its Architecture**
   - Understand what Shiny is and how it works.
   - Understand the difference between `ui.R` and `server.R`.

2. **Basics of Reactive Programming**
   - Understanding reactive expressions, reactive values, and reactive conductors.

3. **Understand UI Layout and Design**
   - How to layout your app using `fluidPage`, `sidebarLayout`, etc.
   - Using UI widgets like `sliderInput`, `numericInput`, etc.

4. **Practice Building Basic Shiny Apps**
   - Build a basic Shiny App using the learnt concepts.

### Weeks 5-6: Deep Dive into R Shiny

1. **Explore Various Input and Output Options in Shiny**
   - Using various types of inputs (`selectInput`, `checkboxInput`, etc) and outputs (`plotOutput`, `tableOutput`, etc).

2. **Understand Reactivity Concepts, observeEvent and eventReactive**
   - Understand how observeEvent and eventReactive work and when to use them.

3. **Practice with More Complex UI and Server Logic**
   - Building a complex Shiny App using multiple inputs and outputs.

### Weeks 7-8: Data Manipulation and Visualization in R Shiny

1. **Use tidyverse Packages for Data Manipulation in Shiny Apps**
   - Using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and other tidyverse packages inside Shiny.

2. **Visualize Data Using ggplot2 and Plotly in Shiny Apps**
   - Making static and interactive plots in Shiny.

### Weeks 9-10: Deployment and Debugging

1. **Learn to Debug Shiny Apps**
   - Using the `browser()` function, understanding error messages.

2. **Understand How to Deploy Shiny Apps on Shiny Server and Shinyapps.io**
   - Deploy your Shiny App on a server or Shinyapps.io.

## Side Project: Gene Expression Visualization App

Throughout this learning journey, we will be working on a side project. The project is to create a Shiny Web Application for visualizing gene expression data. The data can be obtained from public biological databases like NCBI, EBI etc. The app will have features like:

- Viewing gene expression data in a tabular format
- Filtering genes based on user input
- Visualizing gene expression levels across various conditions or experiments using plots

For each week, dedicate some time specifically to the project. It will be a practical application of the concepts you're learning, solidifying your understanding and giving you real-world coding experience. Good luck!
