# Self-teaching R Shiny Web application

## Introduction

I'm a Computer Scientist and decided to learn about the R shiny package and how to make a web application for my dataset for an improvement in one of my work-related projects. 

I created this repository to share my learning plan and steps with others out there. I thought it would help me to stay organized and motivated while it would be good for my resume, future reference, and others trying to figure that out.

I tried to watch some YouTube videos but I'm more comfortable with reading and learning. Also, I can go in a way that is suited to my exact need and learn deeply about the function instead of just incorporating some tools without actually understanding what is going on. 

I have to mention that OF COURSE I used the help of dear ChatGPT in guidance and extracting deeper understanding.

## Learning Path: From basic R to advanced R shiny

In the [Learning Roadmap](./Learning_roadmap.md) file I will list the concepts and topics in each week. I hope this is good for everyone, but I have a habit of skipping some details that are obvious to me.

I tried to start from the beginning. I always need to remember how was each programming language when I come back to them after a while so I removed the burden of getting myself familiarized with R programming language in the future and dedicated the first two weeks to writing a small introduction that covers the basic coding skills in R. 

## Side Project: Gene Expression Visualization App

Throughout this learning journey, we will be working on a side project. The project is to create a Shiny Web Application for visualizing gene expression data. Here is the [detailed explanation of the project](./Project.md). You can obtain the data from public biological databases like NCBI, EBI etc. The app will have features like:

- Viewing gene expression data in a tabular format
- Filtering genes based on user input
- Visualizing gene expression levels across various conditions or experiments using plots

For each week, dedicate some time specifically to the project. It will be a practical application of the concepts you're learning, solidifying your understanding and giving you real-world coding experience. Good luck!
