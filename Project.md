# Side Project: Gene Expression Visualization App

This project aims to create a Shiny Web Application for visualizing gene expression data.

## Timeline and Detailed Steps

### Weeks 1-2: Understanding and Preparing the Data (Approx. 4 hours)

1. **Identify and Download Gene Expression Dataset**
   - Look for publicly available gene expression datasets. Websites like NCBI's GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) or EMBL-EBI's ArrayExpress are good starting points.

2. **Data Understanding and Cleaning**
   - Load the data into R and understand its structure.
   - Perform initial cleaning and preprocessing steps. This might include removing NA values, normalizing the data, etc.

### Weeks 3-4: Building a Basic Shiny App (Approx. 4 hours)

1. **Design Basic Layout**
   - Create a basic UI layout for your app. At this stage, you can have a sidebar for inputs and a main panel to display data.

2. **Display Data**
   - Display your preprocessed gene expression data in a tabular format in the main panel.

### Weeks 5-6: Enhancing the App with User Inputs (Approx. 6 hours)

1. **Add Input Options**
   - Add inputs to the Shiny App so that users can select which gene's data to display.
   - Use reactive expressions to update the output based on user's input.

2. **Data Filtering Based on User Inputs**
   - Update your server logic to filter the gene expression data based on the selected genes.

### Weeks 7-8: Visualizing the Data (Approx. 8 hours)

1. **Visualize Gene Expression Data**
   - Use ggplot2 to create plots for the expression level of selected genes across different conditions or experiments.
   - Enhance these visualizations with Plotly to make them interactive.

### Weeks 9-10: Debugging and Deployment (Approx. 6 hours)

1. **Debug the Shiny App**
   - Test the app rigorously for potential bugs or issues. Use the browser() function and understand any error messages to help in debugging.

2. **Deploy the Shiny App**
   - Deploy your Shiny App on a public server like Shiny Server or Shinyapps.io for others to use.

This timeline is a general guideline and the actual time taken might vary depending on your familiarity with R and programming concepts. Remember to always refer back to what you learned in the corresponding week while working on the project. Good luck!
